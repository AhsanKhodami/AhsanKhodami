# Welcome to Ethan's GitHub 👨‍🔬✨  


Hello! I'm **Ahsan Khodami**, a **Marie Curie Fellow** at the University of Padua, passionate about uncovering the intricacies of visual processing and brain mechanisms. My work bridges **science** and **technology**, focusing on **hemianopia**, **EEG**, and **eye-tracking experiments**.

---

## 🧠 **About My Work**
I specialize in:
- **Visual Temporal Processing**: Investigating how the brain processes stimuli across time.
- **Predictive Coding**: Exploring how spatial cues modulate perception and decision-making.
- **Pupil Size & Blink Analysis**: Utilizing physiological models to reconstruct blink intervals and pupil dynamics.
- **Eye-Tracking and EEG**: Combining tools to understand how we see and process the world.

## 🔬 **Key Projects**
Here’s what I’ve been working on:

### 1. **Temporal Processing in Hemianopia**
- Exploring visual processing speed in patients with hemianopia using **eye trackers** and **EEG**.
- Developed datasets to model temporal resolution and spatial cue impacts.

### 2. **Aperiodic EEG in Visual Tasks**
- Presented findings from the paper *"Aperiodic EEG Predicts Variability of Visual Temporal Processing"* by Deodato & Melcher.
- Enhanced understanding of EEG correlates of visual task performance.

### 3. **Pupil Size & Blink Dynamics**
- Created algorithms to:
  - Detect blinks and reconstruct pupil size during occlusions.
  - Model recovery using physiological dynamics with noise simulations.

## 🖥️ **Experiment Design**
My experimental setup:
- 16-box spatial arrangement for **target detection**.
- Dynamic datasets incorporating:
  - **Cue-based spatial predictions** (circle, square, triangle, etc.).
  - Improvements in **temporal resolution** based on ISI and trial dynamics.
