# Welcome to My GitHub 👨‍🔬✨

Hello! I’m **Ahsan Khodami**, a **Marie Curie Fellow** at the University of Padua. My research delves into the intricacies of visual processing, neural mechanisms, and brain-computer interfaces. With a focus on **hemianopia**, **EEG**, and **eye-tracking experiments**, I bridge **science** and **technology** to understand and model the complexities of human perception.

## 🧠 **About My Work**

I specialize in the following areas:
- **Visual Temporal Processing**: Investigating how the brain processes visual stimuli over time, particularly in clinical populations.
- **Predictive Coding**: Exploring how spatial cues influence perception, decision-making, and visual tasks.
- **Pupil Size & Blink Dynamics**: Reconstructing pupil size and analyzing blink patterns through physiological models and noise simulations.
- **Eye-Tracking & EEG**: Leveraging advanced eye-tracking and EEG technologies to understand how sensory information is processed and acted upon by the brain.

## 🔬 **Key Projects**

Here are some key projects I’ve been working on:

### **1. Temporal Processing in Hemianopia**
- This project explores visual processing speed in individuals with hemianopia, using **eye-trackers** and **EEG** to model how temporal resolution and spatial cues influence task performance.

### **2. Pupil Size & Blink Dynamics**
- I’ve developed algorithms to detect blinks and reconstruct pupil size during occlusions, modeling recovery using physiological dynamics and noise simulations to mirror natural patterns.

## 📦 **Open Source Contributions**

I actively contribute to open-source projects, including:

- **[asc2csv](https://pypi.org/project/asc2csv/)**: A Python package for converting EyeLink `.asc` files to `.csv` format for data analysis.
- **[prpip](https://pypi.org/project/prpip/)**: An automation tool for managing pipeline workflows, featuring version control and deployment via **GitHub Actions**.
- **[etformat](https://pypi.org/project/etformat)**: EyeTracking EDF format conversion and basic analysis

> I use **setuptools_scm** for version management and **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration, automating the build and publishing process for seamless PyPI deployment.

## 🖥️ **Experimental Design**

My experimental setups are designed to evaluate various perceptual and cognitive phenomena:

- **16-Box Spatial Arrangement**: Used for **target detection** with varying inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs).
- **Cue-Based Spatial Predictions**: Trials incorporate cues (e.g., circle, square, triangle) that guide spatial predictions, examining how these cues influence response accuracy.
- **Temporal Resolution**: ISI parameters are adjusted to explore improvements in visual processing speed across different tasks and experimental conditions.
